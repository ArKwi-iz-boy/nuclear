        <h2>What are small modular nuclear reactor?</h2>

        <p class="detail-desc" id="detail-desc"><span>What Are Small Modular Nuclear Reactors?</span>

            Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMNRs) are advanced nuclear power systems designed to be smaller, safer, and more flexible than traditional large-scale nuclear reactors. They represent a new generation of nuclear technology, providing clean, reliable, and efficient energy while minimizing infrastructure and safety challenges.
            
            Unlike conventional nuclear reactors, which can produce over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity, SMNRs typically generate between 10 MW and 300 MW, making them ideal for smaller grids, remote areas, and developing countries. Their modular design allows multiple units to be combined, scaling power production according to demand.</p>
        <p class="detail-desc" id="detail-feature">
           <span> Key Features of SMNRs</span>

Compact Size

SMNRs are built in factories and shipped to sites fully assembled or in modular components.

Their smaller size reduces construction time and cost compared to conventional reactors.

Enhanced Safety Systems

Modern SMNRs use passive safety features, such as natural circulation cooling, gravity-fed emergency systems, and fail-safe shutdown mechanisms.

These features reduce reliance on human intervention and external power sources during emergencies.

Flexible Deployment

SMNRs can be installed in remote locations, near small cities, islands, or industrial zones.

They provide localized, reliable energy, reducing dependency on long-distance electricity transmission.

Lower Capital Costs

Modular construction and smaller size mean faster construction timelines and reduced financial risk.

Multiple units can be added incrementally, spreading investment over time.
        </p>
        <p class="detail-desc" id="detail-work"><span>How SMNRs Work</span>

            Nuclear Fission
            
            SMNRs generate heat through nuclear fission, where the nucleus of an atom (commonly uranium-235 or plutonium-239) splits into smaller fragments.
            
            This process releases energy in the form of heat, which is then used to produce steam.
            
            Heat Transfer & Steam Generation
            
            The heat produced from fission is transferred to a coolant, which may be water, gas, or liquid metal depending on the reactor type.
            
            The heated coolant produces steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity.
            
            Energy Output & Efficiency
            
            SMNRs are optimized for efficiency and reliability, often operating continuously for decades with minimal downtime.
            
            Their smaller power output is ideal for regional energy grids or industrial applications where large reactors are not practical.</p>

            Applications of SMNRs</span>
            
            Remote and Rural Electrification
            
            Many rural areas in developing countries struggle with unstable electricity supply.
            
            SMNRs provide round-the-clock clean energy, powering schools, hospitals, water supply systems, and farms.
            
            Industrial and Commercial Zones
            
            SMNRs can supply dedicated baseload power to factories, data centers, and manufacturing plants.
            
            This enables continuous production, reduces energy costs, and minimizes reliance on fossil fuels.
            
            Disaster-Resilient Power Supply
            
            Due to their passive safety systems, SMNRs can continue to operate safely during natural disasters, such as floods, cyclones, or earthquakes.
            
            They can support emergency infrastructure, hospitals, and communication systems when traditional grids fail.
            
            Integration with Renewable Energy
            
            SMNRs can complement solar and wind energy by providing stable baseload power when intermittent renewables are not generating electricity.
            
            This hybrid approach supports a clean energy transition while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <p class="detail-desc"> <span>Benefits of SMNRs</span>

                Environmental Benefits
                
                SMNRs produce zero greenhouse gas emissions during operation.
                
                They help reduce dependence on coal, diesel, or gas power plants, contributing to cleaner air and climate goals.
                
                Economic Development
                
                By providing reliable electricity, SMNRs stimulate industrial growth, support local businesses, and create jobs in nuclear technology.
                
                They reduce energy costs and encourage sustainable economic development in rural and urban areas.
                
                Scalable & Flexible Deployment
                
                Modular construction allows countries to expand power generation gradually.
                
                SMNRs can be relocated or replaced easily, adapting to changing energy needs.</p>
